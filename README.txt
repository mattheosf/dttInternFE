Hi and welcome on the "Festival Intern Project".
This project is made for the DTT Test over the position of Front End Dev. Internship!

What will you find here?
A nice, I hope on your eyes little app presenting 10 major music festivals being held in Europe.

What are the technologies used and how?
In this app we can find:
PHP- Just a single line to echo in the <script> on festivaldetails the name of the festival the user clicked ($_GET method).
JAVASCRIPT VUEJS- Vue is rendering all the datas here, with for, actions and many more! Also used to register the header and footer and show it everywhere.
JAVASCRIPT TYPESCRIPT- Here TypeScript is used mainly to create a Festival class which will serve as a 
database for the app. All the data regarding the festivals showed on the app are well keep in the class.
JAVASCRIPT JQUERY- Used for some interactions like the "See more festivals" and other stuff.
CSS SASS- I use Sass to enjoy all the variable, the mixin and the fatest way to write Css code.
HTML- Not to forget, our lovely Html which serves for the base of the app and all its balises.
API- Google Maps is the API used here.
Okay okay... I'm sorry for this but I "changed" a bit what was expected with the API on this one, the API was suppose to have all the data.
I have to be honest It scared me a bit at the beginning being asked to use up to 3 technologies I never practiced before and prefered to practice plainly
VueJS and TypeScript on this. But promise, I starting to get all the things to be known about API and etc... the use of get, so I think it will not be that 
much a problem in the future.
Anyway, in order to fullfill the requirement of API, I made my debuts with the Javascript API by Google, it serves to show the location of the festival on 
its page.

What else do we go?
A nice homepage page which presents all the festivals, its location and a short description. All festivals are linked to their details page thanks to the
See more button.
A burger button used for the menu, on both Mobile and Desktop version, the desktop version however hosts some nice colored icons :), and the burger button
is fixed, will then appear also when the user is scrolling.
A categories pages presenting country by country the festival.
A random page presenting a fixed festival Balaton at first: the user by clicking on the targeted button can make appear a new and other festival on the box.
The sitemap is available within the footer of the app.

Well.. I hope you will enjoy this little app, I'm all yours for your asks regarding it, and sorry in advance if some of my code is awful to look at,
I hope not!

I'm here to learn, help me to learn!

Thanks!
