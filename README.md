# internfestivalproject - welcome!
Hi and welcome on the "Festival Intern Project",
This project is made for the DTT Test over the position of Front End Dev. Internship!

## What will you find here?
A nice, I hope on your eyes little app presenting 10 major music festivals being held in Europe.


## What are the technologies used and how?
JAVASCRIPT VUEJS- Vue created with CLI and using Single Files (.vue)
JAVASCRIPT TYPESCRIPT- Here TypeScript is used mainly to create a Festival class which will serve as a 
database for the app. All the data regarding the festivals showed on the app are well keep in the class and the variables are referenced in App.vue vue Vue.prototype
JAVASCRIPT JQUERY- Used for some interactions like the "See more festivals" and other stuff.
CSS SASS- I use Sass to enjoy all the variable, the mixin and the fatest way to write Css code.
HTML- Not to forget, our lovely Html which serves for the base of the app and all its balises.
API- Google Maps is the API used here.
Okay okay... I'm sorry for this but I "changed" a bit what was expected with the API on this one, the API was suppose to have all the data.
I have to be honest It scared me a bit at the beginning being asked to use up to 3 technologies I never practiced before and prefered to practice plainly, even more when I learned I had to create the project with the CLI function which seems now a way more "difficult" to approach on a first basis. I was able to practice 
VueJS a lot on the project and It's starting to get into my mind but not forgetting I still got a lot to learn on this framework. But promise, I'll learn all the things to be known about API and etc... the use of get, so I think it will not be that much a problem in the future.
Anyway, in order to fullfill the requirement of API, I made my debuts with the Javascript API by Google, it serves to show the location of the festival on its corresponding page.

## What else do we got?
A nice homepage page which presents all the festivals, its location and a short description. All festivals are linked to their details page thanks to the
See more button.
A burger button used for the menu, on both Mobile and Desktop version, the desktop version however hosts some nice colored icons :), and the burger button
is fixed, will then appear also when the user is scrolling.
A categories pages presenting country by country the festival.
A random page presenting a fixed festival Balaton at first: the user by clicking on the targeted button can make appear a new and other festival on the box.
The sitemap is available within the footer of the app. (a bit personnalized, I've seen some pages with vue-router-middleware but didn't get it at all)

## My feeling about Vue?
VueJS seems really cool to use, and even more once we start to understand how it works. I'm sure If I am able to work on projects using Vue, I'll enjoy myself a lot and it will be a pleasure to learn much more about this framework. I haven't practice a lot TypeScript on this but It seems it is really common too, so once I will be fluent, if we can say this, I'm pretty sure TypeScript will be the default use in my mind.

Learning coding is so nice, even if we can stuck (a lot, a lot, a lot) of hours on a single thing that was just missing a . , or ;...

Enjoy!
